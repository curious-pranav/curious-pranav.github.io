# Postellas by Pranav.

Hi there! Welcome!

​	I am Pranav Peshwe. I am a Software Architect by profession.

​	[Curious-Pranav](http://curious-pranav.github.io/) is my attempt at creating short write-ups about things that I find interesting and worth sharing.

​	In case you wondered what it means, I coined the term *postella* to mean a post that is longer than a tweet but shorter than a blog. The idea comes from 'novella' - fiction literature longer than a short story but short than a novel. Most of my postellas will be fewer than 250 words, the hard limit set at 300.
