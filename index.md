# Postellas by Pranav.

Hi there! Welcome!

​	I am Pranav Peshwe. I am a Software Architect by profession.

​	[Curious-Pranav](http://curious-pranav.github.io/) is my attempt at creating short write-ups about things that I find interesting and worth sharing.

​	In case you wondered what it means, I coined the term *postella* to mean a post that is longer than a tweet but shorter than a blog. The idea comes from 'novella' - fiction literature longer than a short story but short than a novel. Most of my *postellas* will be fewer than 200 words, the hard limit set at 250.

​	Given that average reading speed hovers around 250 words per minute, no *postella* should take more than 60 seconds to read. *The objective of every postella will be to provoke thought and|at-least share interesting tidbits & hyperlinks.*

​	I surmise, 200 words per *postella* should be sufficient. This one took just 147!
